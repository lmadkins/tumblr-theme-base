# tumblr-theme-base
A comprehensive and flexible base template for Tumblr theme development, customized for my own use.

#### Organization, Variables
The template is thoroughly organized, divided and includes multiple ToCs. A large number of global appearance options and booleans are included, (ex. fonts, hover/permahover, etc.) to easily pick and choose (ex., multiple pagination styles).

#### Styles
Styling is bare, with minimal margins, a simple custom scrollbar, and a meticulous scheme of font-size, color/hover combinations throughout that is
easily controlled by the global appearance toggles.

#### Localization
Whenever possible, link text, titles, and input strings are replaced with Tumblr's localized theme strings, to make them multilingual.
